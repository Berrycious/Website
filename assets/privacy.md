The data collected by the bot is stored in a database which is hosted on MongoDB, encrypted with an AES-256 key that is stored in the bot's config file. Your data can be deleted at any time. We never share your data with a third party for any reason. The bot runs on a password protected platform, thus keeping your data safe. Please keep in mind that even with these protections, no data can ever be 100% secure. We do everything to keep your data secure and private, but its absolute security cannot be guaranteed.
